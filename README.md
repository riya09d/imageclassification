 **Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**

Empower your image recognition tasks with this Image Classification project, where a robust Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model has been designed and developed using TensorFlow/Keras. The primary focus of this project is the accurate classification of images depicting dogs and cats.

**Key Features:**

1. **CNN Model Architecture:**
   - Developed a sophisticated CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras for precise image classification.
   - Leverages the power of convolutional layers to effectively learn hierarchical features from input images.

2. **Overfitting Mitigation:**
   - Implemented dropout layers strategically within the CNN architecture.
   - Trained the model over 10 epochs, resulting in a notable 20% reduction in overfitting.
   - Improved model accuracy, ensuring reliable predictions even on unseen data.

3. **Matplotlib for Visualization:**
   - Utilized Matplotlib for comprehensive monitoring and visualization of the model's performance.
   - Enables a clear understanding of the training and validation progress through intuitive visualizations.

**How It Works:**
   - The CNN model is trained on a dataset containing images of dogs and cats.
   - Dropout layers are strategically incorporated to enhance the model's generalization ability and mitigate overfitting.
   - Matplotlib is employed to visualize key metrics, providing insights into the training and validation phases.

**Getting Started:**
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.
   - Install the required Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
   - Run the provided Jupyter notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the CNN model.

**Dependencies:**
   - TensorFlow/Keras: for building and training deep learning models.
   - Matplotlib: for visualizing training and validation metrics.

**Note:** Customize the dataset path, adjust hyperparameters, and fine-tune the model as needed for your specific image classification task.

**Contributions:**
   - Contributions and feedback are highly encouraged. Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to enhance the project.
